# Jenkins-Server-From-Dockerfile-Deploy-Test-Monitor

# Home Task Given by Mr. Vimal Daga Sir Under DevOps Assembly Lines Training

# Task Overview :
This task has the following series of things to be done :

* 1.	Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed  using dockerfile 
* 2.	When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.
* 3.	Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and  job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 
* 4. Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.
* 5. Job2 : By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image        container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of  PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).
* 6.	Job3 : Test your app if it  is working or not.
* 7.	Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages.
* 8.	Create One extra job job5 for monitor : If container where app is running. fails due to any reson then this job should automatically       start the container again.

# Software Required :
Here we have integrated :
* Jenkins 
* Git
* Docker

# Project Description :

## 1. Jenkins Server from Dockerfile:

I have used Red Hat 8 as my base OS and made a separate directory for this project
` mkdir /task2`
inside it created one Dockerfile for Jenkins server ` vim Dockerfile` :
![dockerfile](https://github.com/disha1822/Jenkins-Server-From-Dockerfile-Deploy-Test-Monitor/blob/master/dockerfile.png?raw=true)

Then to build the **docker image** from it run the command `docker build -t jenkins:v1 .`. 
It will build the image for Jenkins from the Dockerfile in the current directory and after an successful build we will get outout like this:

![build](https://github.com/disha1822/Jenkins-Server-From-Dockerfile-Deploy-Test-Monitor/blob/master/build.png?raw=true)

Now we can check the Jenkins image by ` docker images | grep jenkins` 
Then we can use this image to launch our Jenkins server :
`docker run  -it  --privileged  -v /:/host  -p 1234:8080  --name  jkserver  jenkins:v1`

`--privileged` is used to give special access to run docker commands in host OS through jenkins server.

`-v /:/host` mounting is done for this reason only.

`-p 1234:8080` by exposing port we can access Jenkins server from http://localhost:1234

For first time Jenkins will ask an Initial Admin Password which we can find in the running jenkins container :
![passwd](https://github.com/disha1822/Jenkins-Server-From-Dockerfile-Deploy-Test-Monitor/blob/master/jkstart.png?raw=true)

Now we will do the required settings and install suggested plugins in Jenkins.

## 2. Jobs in Jenkins
Now we will start with our Jobs in Jenkins :

  * Job1 :
  Whenever Developer pushes something new in Github, Job1 coppies the code from Github to a directory inside the Jenkins server  container
  ![a]()
  ![b]()
  ![c]()
  
  * Job2 :
  Successful build of Job1 will trigger Job2 and it will launch the recpective container for the code of the developer.
  Here I have taken example of webpages so I have used apache webserver.
